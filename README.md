# guerillaglass
The native, chaotic-fast "Screen Studio" alternative for macOS. Automatic cinematic zooms, buttery smooth cursor motion, and simulator-first recording. Built with Swift and SwiftUI.

Currently in the 'Move Fast and Break Things' phase. I am committing directly to main until we hit Phase 2. If you want to help, open an issue first so we don't accidentally write the same Metal shader at 2 AM.
