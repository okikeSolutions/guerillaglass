The native, chaotic-fast "Screen Studio" alternative for macOS. Automatic cinematic zooms, buttery smooth cursor motion, and simulator-first recording. Built with Swift and SwiftUI.

## Requirements

- Swift 5.10+

## Build
```
swift build
```

## Run (packaged app)
```
Scripts/compile_and_run.sh
```

Currently in the 'Move Fast and Break Things' phase. I am committing directly to main until we hit Phase 2. If you want to help, open an issue first so we don't accidentally write the same Metal shader at 2 AM.
